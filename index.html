  <h3>1. Everest Base Camp, Nepal</h3>
  <p>
    
    Details: One of the most iconic treks in the world, offering stunning views of the Himalayas and a close encounter with the culture of the Sherpa people.<br>
 Resources:<br>
 1)Lonely Planet<br>
  2) Trekking in Nepal<br>

  The Everest Base Camp trek on the south side, at an elevation of 5,364 m (17,598 ft), 
  is one of the most popular trekking routes in the Himalayas and about 40,0
  00 people per year make the trek there from Lukla Airport (2,846 m or 9,337 ft).[5] Trekkers usually fly 
  from Kathmandu to Lukla to save time and energy before beginning the trek to the base camp.
   However, trekking to Lukla is possible. There are no roads from Kathmandu to Lukla and as a result, 
  the only method of transporting large and heavy goods is by plane.

<h3>3. Annapurna Circuit, Nepal</h3>
<p>
  Details: A classic trekking route that offers a variety of landscapes, from subtropical forests to alpine zones, and stunning views of Annapurna and Dhaulagiri.
  Resources:
  Annapurna Conservation Area
  Nepal Hiking Team
  rekking Annapurna is one of the most immersive ways to experience the mountains in Nepal. If you’re planning a trip to the region for just that, then this is where you should start…

  From the Annapurna Circuit to Annapurna Base Camp, the region of Annapurna is simply a trekking paradise. Those who can tear themselves away from the world of Wi-Fi long enough to commit to a long-distance trek are rewarded with remarkable routes packed with teahouses, Tibetan temples, subtropical lowlands and big, spiky mountain highs.
  
  The legendary Annapurna Circuit is the best known route in the area. It circles the entirety of the Annapurna Massif and is often considered in 10 best treks on the planet lists. The route is akin to hiking through a Himalayan highlights reel.
  
  The Annapurna Circuit is a long-distance trekking route that circles the Annapurna massif.

<h3>The Dolomites, Italy</h3>
<p> 
  Details: This region offers some of the most spectacular mountain scenery in Europe, with jagged peaks, deep valleys, and beautiful alpine meadows.
  Resources:
  Dolomiti Superski
  Alpine Guides
  The Dolomites are a magnificent mountain range in the northern Italian Alps. 
  There are 19 peaks that rise above 10,000 feet. The area features some of the most beautiful mountain landscapes anywhere, with vertical walls, sheer cliffs, and narrow, deep and long valleys. The area is a ski haven in the winter and a hiker’s paradise in the summer. We like staying in Castelrotto and exploring the Alpe di Siusi from there.
   This is a great home base, very near the Val Gardena.
